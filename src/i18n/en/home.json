      "question": "What is Starter UI?",
      "answer": "Starter UI is a professional template made with Astro, designed to build clean and fast websites without starting from scratch. It includes ready sections like Hero, Pricing, FAQ or Blog, with modern design, well-organized CSS tokens and production-ready components."
    },
    "q2": {
      "question": "Does it support multiple languages?",
      "answer": "Yes. The system uses separate folders by language (ES, EN, etc.) along with JSON dictionaries for texts. Blog posts can also have linked translations from their frontmatter, so all content easily adapts to the user's language."
    },
    "q3": {
      "question": "Can I write posts in MDX?",
      "answer": "Of course. Starter UI supports Content Collections with MDX, which allows mixing text with Astro or React components. In addition, each post is validated with Zod, so you maintain total control over the format and avoid content errors."
    },
    "q4": {
      "question": "How do I customize the design?",
      "answer": "All styling is controlled from tokens in src/styles/tokens.css: colors, typography, spacing, shadows and animations. Just change those values and the entire design adapts to your brand. Each section has its own isolated CSS so you can modify without breaking the rest."
